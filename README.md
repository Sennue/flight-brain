# Flight Brain - Flight Computer Engine

THIS README IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

## Overview
Flight Brain is a sophisticated flight computer engine designed to optimize communication and processing within embedded systems. Its core is a powerful, flexible message queue system that handles interactions between various customizable systems and messages. This unique architecture ensures efficient operation, especially in resource-constrained or real-time environments.

## Key Features
- **Message Queue Architecture**: At the heart of Flight Brain is a dynamic message queue system, which orchestrates communications between different systems in a highly efficient manner.
- **User-Defined Systems and Messages**: Offers unparalleled flexibility, allowing users to define systems and messages that align with specific operational requirements.
- **Tick-Based Processing**: Implements a tick-based framework where each system processes messages for the current tick and can enqueue messages for future processing, ensuring a structured and efficient approach.
- **Designed for `no_std` Rust Environment**: Specifically built for `no_std` Rust environments, making it ideal for embedded systems or applications with strict memory constraints.
- **Robust and Modular Design**: Crafted to meet demanding requirements, the framework's modular design allows for easy adaptation and scalability.
- **Illustrative Examples**: Includes a set of examples demonstrating how to use the system effectively, catering to various use cases and providing a solid starting point for new users.


## Getting Started
To use Flight Brain, ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. Rust can be downloaded from [the official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
